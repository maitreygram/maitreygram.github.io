# About Me
I am currently a graduate student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.unc.edu) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu), working with Prof. [Gedas Bertasius](https://www.gedasbertasius.com). My research interest lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Robotics and I'm passionate about applying my research to space science. Currently I'm working on improving the instance segmentation and tracking of objects in videos.
