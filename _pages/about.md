I am currently a graduate student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.unc.edu) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu), working with Prof. [Daniel Szafir](https://www.danszafir.com) and Prof. [Gedas Bertasius](https://www.gedasbertasius.com). My research interests include robotic perception and common sense reasoning in robotics. Recently, I'm working on conditioning large language models to generate situationally aware action plans. In the past I have worked on studying the zero-shot performance of vision transformers for video object segmentation and pose propagation.

I have worked on Graph Machine Learning as a researcher at [AI Garage, Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.co.in/en-in.html) and I'm interested in finding ways to port my experience across fields to my current and future projects. I also interned at [Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) where I worked in the Computer Vision team of the Advanced Technology Lab.

I completed my Bachelors in Technology in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in) where I worked with Prof. [Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr) on my [Undergraduate thesis](https://github.com/maitreygram/maitreygram.github.io/blob/master/thesis/BTP_Report_2.pdf) in the field of 3D Reconstruction in Cryogenic Electron Microscopy. I also was the Software team lead for [The IIT Bombay Mars Rover Team](https://iitbmartian.github.io), where I worked on building rovers capable of traversing on Mars like terrain.
