# About Me
I am currently a graduate student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.unc.edu) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu), working with Prof. [Gedas Bertasius](https://www.gedasbertasius.com). My research interest lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Robotics and I'm passionate about applying my research to space science. Currently I'm working on improving the instance segmentation and tracking of objects in videos.

I have worked on Graph Machine Learning as a researcher at [AI Garage, Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.co.in/en-in.html) and I'm interested in finding ways to port my experience across fields to my current and future projects. I also interned at [Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) where I worked in the Computer Vision team of the Advanced Technology Lab.

I completed my Bachelors in Technology in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in) where I worked on my [undergraduate thesis](https://github.com/maitreygram/maitreygram.github.io/blob/master/thesis/BTP_Report_2.pdf).
