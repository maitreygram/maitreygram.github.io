I'm from India where I travelled across the nation with my family and grew up studying in multiple schools. Interacting with people from varied backgrounds and experiencing many diverse cultures from a young age, I've always been comfortable in interacting with people and was also active in debating and science exhibition clubs, which has contributed to my passion for research. In my free time I like to play the guitar or listen to music. Check out some of my playlists [here](). I sometimes also play basketball or tennis. I also love travelling and hiking. Check out some of the pictures from my hikes [here]().
